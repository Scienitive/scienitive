# Altuğ Alpcan Yaşar

I'm Altuğ from Turkey. I'm currently studying at 42 Istanbul. I enjoy solving problems and creating algorithms. I'm also very much into game development / designing and software development.

Here is some of my works:

## <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1725990/GASERB">GASERB</a>

My first full released game. A puzzle game where the rules of game changes as you play it. Can be a little frustrating time to time but if you like challenging puzzle games I suggest you to try it. It's free.

I make games for game jams from time to time. You can see my work through **<a href="https://scienitive.itch.io">my itch.io address</a>**.

I have a **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLd6u5OLoLwP-pFv9mLiucQ">Youtube Page</a>** where I post the gameplay of my games and the music that I made. You can check there too.

I also share the projects that I made for my school. You can check them out from my Github.
